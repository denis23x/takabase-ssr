				Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an
				unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.

				Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece
				of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock,
				a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure
				Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the
				word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.
