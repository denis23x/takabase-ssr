### Content Moderation

#### 1. AI-Based Review {.divider .divider-start}

By using platform, you agree that your content (both images and text) may be reviewed by AI systems for moderation purposes. The AI will analyze and flag content that violates our community guidelines.

#### 2. Limitations of AI Moderation {.divider .divider-start}

While AI moderation enhances the safety and quality of interactions, it is not infallible. There may be instances where inappropriate content is missed, or where the system incorrectly flags acceptable content.

#### 3. User Responsibility {.divider .divider-start}

Even though AI tools assist in content moderation, users are still responsible for ensuring that all shared content complies with our community guidelines. Content not flagged by the AI may still be subject to review and removal.

#### 4. Human Review {.divider .divider-start}

In cases of disputes or appeals, flagged content may be escalated to human moderators for further review and resolution.
