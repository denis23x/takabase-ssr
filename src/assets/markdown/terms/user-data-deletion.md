### User data deletion

Take a moment to ensure you have saved any important information before proceeding with the account deletion. If you wish to delete your account permanently, please follow these steps:

- Go to **Settings**
- Navigate to **Account**
- Click on **Delete Account**

By confirming the deletion, your account will be permanently removed from Takabase. Please note that this process is irreversible, and once your account is deleted, it cannot be recovered. This action will result in the deletion of:

- Your account and all associated personal information
- All categories and posts you have created
- Any images you have uploaded
- Any cookies associated with your account
- All sign-in methods associated with your account

If you decide to return to Takabase in the future, you will need to start over by creating a new account. All previously deleted information will not be retrievable, and you will begin with a fresh start.
