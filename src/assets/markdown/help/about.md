## Work In Progress

Please note that Takabase is currently a work in progress. While the platform undergoes continuous refinement and enhancement, it’s important to keep in mind that some features may be subject to change or even removal. Your understanding during this phase is greatly appreciated.

The goal is to provide users with clear and concise guidance on account management, troubleshooting, feature explanations, and more. User feedback is valued, and efforts are made to continuously enhance the platform’s features and usability based on community input.
